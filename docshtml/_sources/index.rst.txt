VenusTools
==========

**VenusTools** is a set of functions designed to help working with Venus data from the Venus Express mission.
There are currently two different pseudo Python classes in **VenusTools**, 
which are stand-alone (they do not depend on each other): VeRaTools and VMCTools.

The GitHub repository can be found `here <https://github.com/PleaseStateTheNatureOfYourInquiry/VenusTools>`_.
